My name is Hari, and I've been interning at SpanishDict for a few weeks now.
This will be the first of a series of blog posts about experiences here at
SpanishDict.

I love SpanishDict! Headquarters are in Arlington, VA, just minutes outside
the city limits. I've never lived in DC, so it's been quite an adventure, both
during work and after work. I've really taken a liking to the DC area, both the
Foggy Bottom/downtown area where I live, as well as the Arlington/Clarendon
area where I work. There are lots of places to go and things to do, and I feel
like my time here is already slipping away.

Working in the office is awesome -- everybody knows each other and there are
lots of fun events! Day to day, things never get boring -- just the other day,
one of the guys in the office next door left us a whole box of donuts! I'm
looking forward to the rest of the summer (especially when The Dark Knight
Rises comes out, which we're all going to go see together :D).

I am currently working on creating interactive features for the front-end
of the site. More specifically, I have been implementing a series of
language testing features, such as multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank,
matching, etc. I have been working mostly in Coffeescript and Backbone.js to
create the infrastructure of my web app. Backbone has allowed me to easily
create and render the views and templates that I want, and its flexibility
and events handling are really great, too. More recently, I have been working
on generating the specific questions I can use for my quizzes, and how to go
about deciding what kinds of questions I should display.

Since I love interactive games and other such devices,
making these features for the website is right up my alley. I'm excited
to see what else I can do this summer to help make the site even better
than it is now (tough, right?).

Hasta luego! (Until next time!)
