SpanishDict is looking forward to hosting the first meetup of the new 
[NovaNode meetup group][meetup]. Two outstanding Node.js talks are lined up for the evening. The
event will be held on March 20th at 6:30pm at our offices in Arlington, Virginia. 
For more information be sure to checkout the [Meetup event page][meetup].

### The Emergence of Node.js on the Web

We are supporting the Node.js community here locally because
we have been particularly impressed with potential of [Node.js][nodejs] to marshall
in a new era of scalable, performant, real-time web applications. 
The event-driven, non-blocking design along with the super-fast V8 engine
has yielded phenominal performance stastics on the systems where we have 
deployed Node. We are also excited by the possibility of using the same 
programming language on both the client and server. These [advantages][quora] 
unlock the potential for a number of compelling [use cases][usecases] and have 
propelled Node's rapid rise in [popularity][vsruby].

### The Emergence of Node.js in Virginia

Here in Virginia, just outside of Washington DC, we have seen evidence of 
Node's increasing influence. In the first week that we launched the NovaNode
meetup group, along with our friends at 
[tixelated][tixelated], **over 50 people** joined the group. 
Developers with expertise in almost every language have signed up with a 
tremendous amount of curiousity and enthusiasm. Javascript has long been the 
lingua franca of the browser, so many developers have some familiarity with the
language. At the NovaNode meetup, we are looking forward to exploring, demoing, 
testing, using, critiquing and sharing new developments in the world of Node. 
Be sure to check the [NovaNode Meetup][meetup] page for more information 
on this and future events.
