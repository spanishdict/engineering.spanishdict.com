We had a blast hosting the first [NovaNode][meetup] meetup group here at 
[SpanishDict][spanishdict]. For those of your who
missed it, we had around 30 developers, pizza, beer, and two great speakers. The
presentations are available here:

* [Getting Started with Node.js in the Cloud][nodejs_cloud]
* [OAuth User Management with Everyauth and MongoDB][oauth]

More photos from the event are available on the [meetup page][meetup_event]. 
We are in the process
of planning the next event, which is currently scheduled for May 1st. We look 
forward to hosting it.
