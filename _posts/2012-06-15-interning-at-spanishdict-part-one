My name is Hari, and I've been interning at [SpanishDict][spanishdict] for a
few weeks now. This will be my first of a series of blog posts about my
experiences here at SpanishDict.

I love SpanishDict! Headquarters are in Arlington, VA, just minutes outside
the city limits. I've never lived in DC, so it's been quite an adventure,
both during work and after work. I really enjoy working here -- everybody
knows each other and there are lots of fun events! Day to day, things never
get boring -- today, one of the guys in the office next door left us a whole
box of donuts! I'm looking forward to the rest of the summer (especially
when The Dark Knight Rises comes out. :D).

I currently am working on creating interactive features for the front-end
of the site. More specifically, I have been implementing a series of
language testing features, such as multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank,
matching, etc. Since I love interactive games and other such devices,
making these features for the website is right up my ally. I'm excited
to see what else I can do this summer to help make the site even better
than it is now (tough, right?).

Hasta luego! (Until next time!)
